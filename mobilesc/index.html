          <h2>Mobile Supercomputers Are Getting Super-er</h2>
          <p>“Siri, where is the Sea of Tranquility?” People listening to transmissions from Apollo 11 in 1969 might have heard those words if there had been an iPhone aboard the spacecraft as it approached the Moon.
But iPhones didn’t exist back then. The United States sent Apollo 11 astronauts to the Moon with a guidance computer that was two feet wide, weighed 70 pounds, had a processor speed of 1 MHz, 4 KB of memory (about 2,048 words), power consumption of 55 watts and a cost of $150,000. Today’s Apple iPhone 4S is a little more than two inches wide, weighs 4.9 ounces, has a processor with a speed of 800 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, and power consumption of about 1 watt, all at a cost of about $200.</p>
          <p>Computers have come a long way in 40 years, and mobile computers have come the farthest in the shortest time – some of them are more powerful than early supercomputers. A tweaked Motorola Droid can hit speeds more than 15-times faster than the Cray-1 supercomputer of 1979. Apple's iPad 2 rivals the Cray 2 supercomputer, the world's fastest computer in 1985. What will smartphones look like in eight years? Jeff Bradley, a developer at AT&T, predicts it’ll have 28 GHz of processing power, embedded storage of 64 terabytes and a 500 Mbps connection to the mobile data network.</p>
          <p>Mobile devices have evolved from being very powerful computers to what we considered, just a few years ago, to be supercomputers, and they continue to hurry toward levels of performance that, just a decade ago, we didn’t imagine would be possible.</p>
          <p>The use of smart phones to text, stream and surf the Web required engineers to develop blazing-fast processors. Power, speed and storage have increased steadily. But the demand for smaller phones and resource-hungry operations such as converting the information from a camera sensor to a JPEG, processing video or unpacking a compressed file are pushing the technology to its physical limits – there are a number of restrictions that prevent processors from working at full capacity.

		<p>Of those restrictions, the prominent two are excessive heat and sufficient power. Of those two, heat seems to be the bigger obstacle.</p>

		<p>The faster the chip, the more power is required for operation, and battery technology hasn’t kept pace with chip development. However, each increase in processing power requires more transistors on chips, and as their number grows, the interconnecting wires get thinner, which increases resistance, makes them less energy-efficient and produces excessive heat.</p>

		<p>Whereas desktops and laptops have space for fans to move air in and out to cool their chips, mobile devices such as smart phones, iPads and readers don’t have that advantage. In producing excessive heat, transistors can melt themselves and surrounding components. When heat rises to a level that’s impractical to dissipate, chips hit “the power wall.” So the amount of work they can do at any given time is limited.</p>

		<p>This dilemma is described by Moore’s Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months. Overcoming the limitations of this law might be the biggest obstacle that engineers face in improving the performance of mobile computers.</p>

		<p>Tom Wenisch is the Morris Wellman Faculty Development Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. He and a team of engineers from the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania have proposed a solution.</p>

		<p>“Currently, the processors are designed for sustained performance; that is, they turn on and run full tilt and don’t stop. Logic would say that, to decrease the heat, you would need to lower the number of transistors on a chip. Our process is counterintuitive. It says, go ahead, put more transistors on a chip to boost performance, but use them only when they’re needed to do their assigned tasks. When they complete their tasks, they turn off and cool down until they’re needed again. We call the inactive processors ‘silicon,’ and the overall technique ‘computational sprinting.’”</p>

		<p>Most of today’s smartphone have chips with 16 processors. “Batteries don't have enough power to run 16 cores at once, even if we wanted them all to be active,” Wenisch said. “So, we program chips to sprint. When a core isn’t needed for a task and goes dark, power is stored in a capacitor until the next time a surge is needed. That way, when the processor sprints, it draws power from both the battery and the capacitor. This extends batter life andincreases the device’s response time ten-fold.”</p>

		<p>The team is working to decrease a processor’s off-time to 300 milliseconds. “That’s short enough to go unnoticed but long enough to allow the processor to cool down,” Wenisch said.</p>

		<p>Wenisch also has been testing a material – something like candle wax – to be a phase-change heatsink. “As the material melts, or changes phase, it absorbs a huge amount of heat and holds the temperature at a constant level,” Wenisch said. “As the processor slowly cools off, the material cools, too. It’s a closed loop; theoretically, the cycle could continue for the life of the chip.”</p>

		<p>Work on heat dissipation is ongoing elsewhere. IBM researchers have been working on a chip that’s cooled AND powered by fluid. The investigators stack hundreds of silicon wafers on top of each other to create three-dimensional processors, which are dense but have relatively little surface area for cooling. To solve that problem, engineers run a pair of fluidic networks between each layer. One carries in charged fluid to power the chip, the second carries away the same fluid after it has picked up heat from the active transistors — in essence, the system is a microfluidic battery. Researchers got the idea by studying the human brain, which is 10,000-times denser than any computer processor. The brain’s network of capillaries and blood vessels transports heat and energy, all at the same time, to achieve efficiency.</p>

		<p>Back at Michigan Engineering, lower heat emissions were a serendipitous product of work done to create chips that are smaller, faster and low-cost. Wei Lu, an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and his team built a chip composed of nanoscale memristors, computer components that offer both memory and logic functions, and make it possible to achieve their objective: chips that are smaller, faster and low-cost. The team also found that memristors require less energy to operate and, consequently, they produce less heat. Their memory function works even when current is not passing through them, in which case no heat is generated. Furthermore, memristors have the potential to power handheld devices with 10-times the embedded memory possible today.</p>

		<p>Experimenting with ultra-low-power mobile chip architectures has become a major area of interest not only because chips of this type produce less heat, but also because they make it possible to squeeze more FLOPS (a measure of computer performance) out of their machines.</p>

		<p>Trevor Mudge is the Bredt Family Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the co-founder of Michigan Engineering’s Advanced Computer Architecture Lab (ACAL). He said that developing mobile supercomputers will “require rethinking the way we design computers. Rather than worrying solely about performance, with the occasional nod to power consumption and cost, we need to judge computers by their performance-power-cost. This new way of looking at processors will lead us to new computer architectures and new ways of thinking about computer system design.”</p>

		<p>He and his team have developed Centip3De (“centipede”), a chip that uses three-dimensional processors to open up an entirely new process – near-threshold computing (NTC). Its objective is run a processor at low voltage to consume less energy – without giving up performance. Just as computational sprinting uses processors only as they’re needed, a Centip3De chip uses only enough power to operate transistors at a given moment. That is, there’s a voltage tipping point – below it, transistors don’t operate, above it they do. The lower power consumption makes it attractive for use in chips with a stacked design, which has a limited ability to dissipate heat but improves power and performance compared to two-dimensional chips. “If you can lower voltage supply by forty percent, you get an eighty to ninety percent reduction in energy consumption. However, at low power, transistors work slowly,” Mudge said. “We want Centip3De to run as fast as it can at low voltage, because key processes must run quickly.”</p>

		<p>Mudge and his team are also working on smoothing out congestion points – points where data flow hits a bottleneck. “A computer’s performance is constricted by its lowest-performing part. If you have a million processors running in parallel but one element is slow, then everything on highway will slow down.” To understand why this is so, it’s helpful to know a couple of basics about processors.</p>

		<p>Generally, processors fall into two configurations: vector and parallel. Think of a vector processor as a single person solving a series of 20 math problems in consecutive order. In a parallel processor, there might be 20 people, each assigned to solve one of the problems in the series. So, with a greater number of people (processors) working even at low power (and, consequently, more slowly), a group can usually complete an operation more quickly – but never faster that its slowest member (lowest performing part).</p>

		<p>Another one of the Mudge team’s energy-efficiency projects resulted in the Intelligent Energy Manager (IEM) system, a technology that enables mobile phones to automatically self-adjust their battery usage. A novel interconnect methodology allows dozens of microprocessors to talk to one another in an energy-efficient manner on a single ARM chip. (An ARM chip is a parallel processor that requires only a very small fraction of the transistors used on many conventional chips. With fewer transistors there’s less energy demand, which makes it useful in smaller devices.)</p>

		<p>Intel is developing a 48-core processor for smartphones and tablets, an architecture that would allow a device to distribute tasks among the different parts of the chip, making the processor faster and more power-efficient, boosting mobile performance farther into the realm of supercomputers.</p>

		<p>The entire industry is poised to make an unprecedented leap. Some engineers predict that, in the next five years, next-gen mobile supercomputers – smartphones, iPads, readers – will run people’s homes remotely (even water the plants). They’ll oversee personal fitness programs and send continuous streams of health information to doctors, securely, in real time. They’ll accommodate augmented reality (travelers could, for example, point a phone down a city street anywhere in the world, and an overlay of nearby historic landmarks, restaurants and hotels would appear). Paper-thin flexible screens will fold out from pocket-size devices to become large screens on which to watch movies and play games. Holograms will hover above screens. Voice-recognition systems will interpret diction and syntax rather than just dumbly recognize sound waves.</p>

		<p>What will happen 10 years from now is anyone’s guess. A good suggestion is to wait out the next five years and then ask Siri.</p>
