<p><a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/academics/gradprograms/gradwelcome/">http://www.engin.umich.edu/academics/gradprograms/gradwelcome/</a><br /><b>Stamps Auditorium </b> <br /><b>Wednesday, August 29, 2012 </b></p>

<p><span>Welcome</span></p>

<ul>

<li>Every year I’m excited to meet a new class of students. Each of you has a fascinating story. I look forward to meeting you individually.</li>

<li>Some of you have traveled from across Asia and Africa; some have come from Ann Arbor; many have arrived from various points in between. What you have in common is that all of you have been and      still desire to be successful. </li>

<li>We’re here to help you achieve your goals and dreams. That is why we devote this day to your transition. We’re delighted and excited you’re here, and we want you to have a terrific experience at the University of Michigan.</li>

<li>I want to elaborate on your class just a bit; remind you why you made a great choice, as I share a few highlights about the state of the College; and offer you a challenge.</li>

</ul>

<p><span>A super class </span></p>

<ul>

<li>As pleased as we are by our stellar student body, your presence reflects our recent efforts to become even more selective. Your class sets a new standard. We’re proud to have such a talented group joining our creative and innovative community.</li>

<li>This year, under the new leadership of Alec, we recruited harder and smarter. We did more outreach and more follow up to ensure the best students understood what a tremendous opportunity awaited them at Michigan. We didn’t settle for “good” graduate students. We indeed sought out the Leaders and Best.</li>

<li>You will benefit. In the classroom and the research lab. The talent and diversity that will surround you will help you produce and test your best thinking. You will be challenged, but you also can be confident that you belong here, because we wanted you.</li>

</ul>

<p><span>The right choice</span></p>

<ul>

<li>Your arrival strengthens a group of students and faculty who already are leaders in research.</li>

<li>In fact, the University of Michigan has the largest research portfolio of any public university in the U.S. at $1.24 billion; $180 million of that research is generated by the College of Engineering. </li>

<li>Across 12 departments and divisions, dozens of programs and several centers, Michigan Engineering faculty and graduate students excel as creative investigators who are leaders in their fields. </li>

<li>Recent research developments include:          

<ul>

<li>CEE: Most of the bacteria in drinking water are traceable to filters used in the water treatment process, rather than to the aquifers or rivers where bacteria originate. In a six-month National Science Foundation study, researchers took a unique, broad-based look at Ann Arbor’s water supply, from source to tap. The results could open the door to more sustainable processes with fewer chemicals and lower health risks. Eventually, the work could enable engineers to control the types of microbes in drinking water to improve human health like “live and active cultures” in yogurt, the researchers say.</li>

<li>MSE: Engineers and artists at U-M will receive nearly $2 million from NSF for an interesting four-year research study to determine whether the art of origami could bring nanotechnology into the third dimension. Industry is highly proficient at patterning flat surfaces down to the nanometer scale, but integrating nanostructures into larger and three-dimensional materials and devices has proved trickier to master. With an origami-like approach, manufacturers could potentially use existing machinery to make high-tech paper that could be folded into the desired device. Researchers are seeking solutions by crossing the boundaries between engineering and art.</li>

<li>AOSS: U-M engineers, scientists, students and alumni all have had roles in the historic Curiosity mission, which is searching for evidence that Mars could support microbial life. Faculty were members of the science team. Engineers in the Space Physics Research Lab built the computer controls of the rover's cornerstone lab. Teams of Michigan Engineering students conducted experiments to help NASA understand how much dust the rover's landing process would disturb and the impact on the rover itself.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>We’re also leaders in several innovative programs that focus on the applications of research, such as:           

<ul>

<li>Master’s in entrepreneurship joint program between the College and U-M’s Ross School of Business—enrolling its first students this fall </li>

<li>Naval Engineering Education Center—U-M leads a 15-university consortium, to develop the Navy’s future workforce through project-based education</li>

<li>NSF I-Corps—The NSF selected U-M as one of only three schools for its Innovation Corps entrepreneurship program. I-Corps is designed to help engineers and scientists from around the country quickly move their ideas from research labs to the marketplace.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>And our adjunct faculty and teaching ranks include four distinguished “professors of practice”:          

<ul>

<li><b>Jim Bagian</b>

<p>Jim is an engineer, a medical doctor and an astronaut. He joined us from the VA Hospital system. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. Jim is leading a research and educational program in health engineering.</p>

</li>

<li><b>Donald Winter</b>

<p>Don served as secretary of the U.S. Navy from 2006-2009. He is a retired senior executive of Northrop Grumman Corp. Don led a panel created by the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, investigating the causes of the BP/Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil disaster. Don teaches a graduate-level class on the development of complex systems.</p>

</li>

<li><b>Larry Burns</b>

<p>Larry served as GM’s vice president of research and</p>

<p>development and strategic planning. He is director of the Roundtable on Sustainable Mobility with The Earth Institute at Columbia University. Here and at Columbia his focus is energy policy and transportation.</p>

</li>

<li><b>Harvey Bell</b>

</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Just as we are committed to making an impact on our world through research and teaching, we want you to make your own impact.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>We hope your lasting memory will be that here at      Michigan, you realized your full potential, and made a difference.</li>

<li>You’ll join the company of thousands of Michigan Engineering alumni who have succeeded in a broad range of endeavors, for example:</li>

<ul>

<li>Administration: <b>Chuck Vest</b></li>

<li>Government: <b>Kristine Svinicki</b> (Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner - one of five)</li>

<li>Entrepreneurship and corporate leadership: <b>Larry Page</b> (co-founder, Google) and <b>Tony Fadell</b> (leader of the team that created the iPod)</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p><span>The future</span></p>

<ul>

<li>I hope you are as enthusiastic about what lies ahead as I am.</li>

<li>This is an exciting time to become a part of the Michigan Engineering community.</li>

<li>Strategic plan goals: Creative Community; Strategic Use of Resources;<b> Lead, Take Smart Risks and Make a Broader Impact</b></li>

<li><span>One of plan’s three major initiatives:</span>

<p><b>Michigan IdeaWorks</b> <b>and its MCubed seed funding</b>—We are empowering faculty-led teams (with student support) to pursue high-impact research initiatives that hold promise in emerging areas. Typical projects will be premature for traditional Federal funding sources, but ripe for innovative approaches transcending standard engineering explorations. Now every other school and college in the University also has agreed to participate. Each CoE faculty member has a $20,000 token. When he or she partners with two other faculty, at least one of which is outside of Engineering, they may spend their funds as a group (for example to hire a graduate student) and launch their project—without any other paperwork.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Other activity in progress:</li>

<ul>

<li>A $9.5 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is helping to fund the $46-million Center of Excellence in Nano Mechanical Science and Engineering. The Center will enable researchers to study the forces at work at the smallest scales and to advance nano-technologies in energy, manufacturing, health care and biotechnology. A three-story complex will include 60 lab modules and space for 18 professors in a 62,000+ square-foot addition to the G.G. Brown Laboratories. Construction is expected to start soon.</li>

<li>In addition, the State of Michigan is providing $30 million to help fund renovation of G.G. Brown—which is home to the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering.</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p><span>Your comfort zone</span></p>

<ul>

<li>I’m      sure, as you prepare to start the academic year, you’re focused on your      area of specialty. As you should be. Obviously, most of your time will be      taken up by completing your academic program.</li>

<li>As a      result, you will learn and discover much. I encourage you to develop      relationships with faculty in your department. Those connections can be as      meaningful as anything you do in the classroom or lab.</li>

<li>But make some time for the rest of the world around you.</li>

<li>Take advantage of the U-M experience--it will be unlike      that at any other institution.</li>

<li>Don’t      miss this tremendous opportunity to learn from faculty and colleagues in      other disciplines.</li>

<ul>

</ul>

<li>U of M has nearly 100 programs ranked nationally in the top ten, including ten graduate programs within the College of Engineering.</li>

<li><span>No</span> other university can claim top-ten rankings for all of the following disciplines: engineering, medicine, law, public policy <span>and</span> the performing arts.</li>

<li>Dearborn (one of the largest Arabic populations outside of the Middle East)</li>

<li>Detroit (still a primary hub of the auto industry, and home to Motown music and professional football, baseball and hockey)</li>

<li>Canada (just across the Detroit River—but you will need a passport.)</li>

<ul>

</ul>

<li>And      don’t forget about your non-academic interests. Those hobbies that inspire      and refresh you. Those other activities can produce some of your best      ideas. A club or a group outside of your program can be a great way to      re-energize you and help you think about research problems in new ways.</li>

<li>Ann      Arbor is rich in arts, culture, restaurants, entertainment and, of course,      Big Ten sports.</li>

<li>And      within      half an hour, you can experience the diversity of cultures in:</li>

</ul>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<ul>

<li>You are a great group entering a great institution. And you will do great things.</li>

<li>I know you’ll tackle big challenges, benefit from the Engineering colleagues and resources available to you, and do amazing work during your time here.</li>

<li>My challenge to you is to make time to experience all that this University and its surroundings have to offer. What you discover outside of the lab and classroom, and the people you meet along the way, will amaze you and open your eyes to fresh ways of seeing your world.</li>

<li>Again, welcome, and I wish you the best for a productive and enjoyable start to your Michigan graduate-school careers.</li>

<h2>Undergraduate Graduation</h2>

<p><b>Hill Auditorium<br />Sunday, April 29, 2012</b></p>

<p>Good morning. I’m Dave Munson, Robert J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering. Welcome to the University of Michigan College of Engineering commencement. As you, by now, have participated in the University-wide graduation exercises, I can <span>officially</span> say congratulations to the Class of 2012!</p>

<p>Let me extend a special greeting to part of the Michigan Engineering family watching our simulcast in Rackham Auditorium, where we recognized graduate students earlier this morning. We appreciate your participation.</p>

<p>With the death of <b>Steve Jobs</b> last October, a creative legend and historic icon left our midst. He was a pioneer who almost singlehandedly transformed at least five industries—computing, music, telephones, movies and retail. According to <i>Fortune</i> magazine, he was “the greatest entrepreneur of our time.”  So perhaps it is not surprising that his sister, <b>Mona Simpson,</b> said that even when severely ill, Steve spent time during his last year sketching designs of new ideas. And she reports his final six words on this planet were indeed expressions of wonderment:</p>

<p>“OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW.”</p>

<p>Your similar drive to do special things and your never-ending sense of wonder are among the gifts that you each brought to the University of Michigan. And I encourage you to take them with you, out into the world you now enter as leaders and best.</p>

<p><b>Julie Bateman</b>, who’s seated somewhere out there in the Civil and Environmental Engineering section, also is an Honors Program graduate in LSA. Last month, Julie received the Hugh G. Rumler Prize as Engineering’s outstanding senior—an award she received in part because she created a school and community center in Brazil—an amazing feat. Thursday night, Julie received the LSA Honors Program Raoul Wallenberg award for that same project. When she gave her Rumler Prize remarks, Julie said what she loved about Michigan was “professors still have the imaginations of sophomores.” I hope you recent seniors and now new alumni still do, too.</p>

<p>Creativity means going against conventional thinking; taking some calculated—or uncalculated—risks. Then to make that creativity impactful, sometimes it requires sticking with your idea, even in the wake of failure. And it means exposing yourself to the unfamiliar—environments, disciplines, people. For some of you, it may mean stepping away occasionally from technological pursuits to develop public policy, explore the arts or contemplate the human condition. Steve Jobs studied calligraphy. And Apple’s superb designs reflect his diverse interests.</p>

<p>Now as a parent, who’s sent four kids to college, I can appreciate the angst many in this auditorium may be feeling as I encourage their sons and daughters to go out on a limb…rather than go get that job!</p>

<p>And some of you new graduates may not have quite the same focus on creativity that you had your sophomore year. You may actually be sitting out there with just a tinge of fear about the future. So big bucks may have big appeal.</p>

<p>But here’s Jobs talking about his job:</p>

<p>“Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful… that’s what matters to me.”</p>

<p>And that’s an OH WOW statement, indeed.</p>

<p>Sure, you have to make a living. But you still have to live your life. Don’t sacrifice your big ideas for a little comfort.</p>

<p>At Michigan, where every nook and cranny is full of incredibly talented students, staff and faculty, the environment you’ve experienced has been an incubator for innovative thinking. If you’re wearing a graduation cap today, for sure you’ve done creative things during the last few years. Don’t stop now! Take that mindset wherever you go; that excitement, those possibilities, your spark, passion and sense of wonder!</p>

<p>Steve Jobs had it. <b>Larry Page</b> has it. And so do Michigan alumni <b>Shawn and Shane Ward</b> who run a designer-shoe company in New York City. And so do the Michigan founders of Get Fresh Detroit, <b>Noam Kimelman and Zach Markin</b>. And so does Julie Bateman.</p>

<p>You have it, too.  I know because I’ve observed you. (Because this is my sixth year as dean, I’ve probably been in my role as long as <span>most</span> of you have been here.) You’ll always be a part of the Michigan Engineering creative community. You can—and will—make a difference.</p>

<p>In <i>Business Week</i> in 2004, Steve Jobs said: “Process makes you more efficient. But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we’ve been thinking about a problem. It’s ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea.”</p>

<p>Don’t you want to do the coolest new thing ever? It won’t be easy. It’s going to take a lot of hard work. But you know that, and you can handle it. You’re used to it. As you’ve heard before, “This is Michigan, for God’s sakes!”… You just have to stay focused, despite achieving today’s major milestone.</p>

<p>In the words of <b>Jonah Lehrer</b>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> author of a recent article on creativity, “Sometimes, we just need to keep on working, resisting the temptation of a beer-fueled nap.” My own slant on this is if you’re in a kayak, put your paddle in the river and <span>go</span> someplace. Don’t just float around!</p>

<p>Steve Jobs must have had fears. He knew failure. Apple I. Lisa. NeXT Computer. But he never let fear of failure, or desire for material comforts and convenience, or even the imminent prospect of death, keep him from chasing the next “insanely great” thing.</p>

<p>Like Steve Jobs, and the role models in your lives, and countless Michigan Engineering alumni, you have the creativity to do amazing things. You already have. And I know the last words have not been spoken by or about the Class of 2012!</p>

<p>So congratulations on this accomplishment. Now, go WOW them, and Go Blue!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>University of Michigan and National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) Michigan Robotics Day</h2>

<p><b>NCRC, Building 18 Dining Hall</b><br /><b>Monday, April 9, 2012</b></p>

<p>On behalf of the University of Michigan, welcome to North Campus, and Happy Robotics Day! I’d like to extend a special welcome to our guests from Washtenaw Community College and other academic institutions, and to the members of the corporate, entrepreneurial, non-profit and government sectors who have made time to be with us today.</p>

<p>The word “robot” originates from Czech and Slavic words meaning compulsory or monotonous labor. Perhaps in the 1920s, when the word was popularized, that was true. But apparently, robots, like humans, enjoy variety. Today’s robots fly airplanes, perform surgery and disable bombs. Compulsory labor yes, but hardly monotonous.</p>

<p>U-M Assistant Professor Edwin Olson has said that building a robot is “fiendishly complicated. Humans are marvelous creatures – we make it all look easy. Our brains are amazing learning machines, but also critical are our innate hard-wired capabilities. It took a few billion years for nature to figure out the right balance, and I’m not that patient. It’s a challenge.”</p>

<p>This great <span>potential</span> of robots to do all sorts of amazing things, coupled with the extreme difficulty of actually making those things happen, is the reason why universities have a vital role in the development of robotics technology.</p>

<p>Government, through entities such as the US Army’s Tank-Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), is an important developer of robotics technology, for national defense. For example, TARDEC’s Robotics System Integration Lab and Vehicle Bay facility enables component technologies – such as perception systems, and human detection and intent analysis hardware/software – to be developed and integrated in a laboratory setting.</p>

<p>Industry, seeking to make the most of market opportunities, also has been instrumental in the progress of robotics. For example, last year SoarTech was awarded a DARPA contract to “enable robots to acquire language capabilities… giving them the ability to hypothesize and perform automated reasoning in the acquired language.” And SAIC, which was founded in 1969 by four-time University of Michigan alumnus Bob Beyster and a small group of scientists,<b> </b>has “successfully demonstrated a system of 100 heterogeneous robots, communications, and intelligent software collaborating to map an unknown building, detect and track an intruder, and guard an item of interest.”</p>

<p>But government and industry alone will not realize the full potential of this opportunity. Research universities also are critical to technological progress.</p>

<p>In fact, since the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, universities, largely supported by Federal funding, have been national leaders in basic research. Medicine, transportation and information technology are among other fields that have benefited considerably.</p>

<p>Academic research focused on robotics is occurring at institutions across this country and around the world.</p>

<p>Last month, a team at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan announced the development of a turbo-jet robot aircraft named Sky Fortress-III to be used for typhoon surveillance and disaster prevention.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, University of Washington and University of California, Santa Cruz researchers completed the development of seven robotic surgery systems. These applications will be shared with colleagues at Johns Hopkins, Harvard, UC Berkeley, the University of Nebraska, and UCLA.</p>

<p>But today, our focus is the State of Michigan. Here at the University of Michigan, we are proud of the difference we are making in robotics research and education.</p>

<p>Built in 2008 in collaboration with a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, MABEL is the world’s fastest bipedal robot with knees (and her video has received more than 400,000 viewings on YouTube!). With continual improvements in her development here at Michigan, MABEL could help pave the way for robots that can better navigate rough terrain. And future research may explore how robots could save lives in search and rescue missions, or could be used to develop exoskeletons for people who are paralyzed.</p>

<p>Also in 2008, the Ground Robotics Reliability Center (GRRC) was established at U-M. GRRC’s vision was to help establish Southeastern Michigan as a center of activity for these emerging technologies by supporting programs in research and education. GRRC research projects have now been folded into the ARC (Automotive Research Center) and are primarily sponsored by TARDEC. U-M leads the effort, which includes partners from other academic institutions across the state and industry. Research spans a range of areas, including developing advanced autonomous robots able to make decisions in the field and execute tactical behavior changes to achieve goals; and reliability, manufacturing and repair.</p>

<p>In the next few years, we hope to consolidate our numerous robotics research groups at U-M into a comprehensive center to achieve synergies of speed and impact and improved coordination with our external partners.</p>

<p>Our educational developments have included a two year-old master of engineering degree program in robotics and autonomous vehicles. It is designed to provide focused engineering education for students who are interested in design, creation, and use of mobile robots or intelligent vehicles. Artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, computational game theory, and mechanism design are among the elements of this course of study.</p>

<p>And a year and a half ago, a U-M student team, under the leadership of Ed Olson, captured the $750,000 first prize in an international robotics competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and its Australian counterpart.</p>

<p>From a longer-term but equally significant perspective, I am excited about the University’s partnership with the Detroit Public Schools and FIRST Robotics, the creation of Segway entrepreneur and National Medal of Technology recipient Dean Kamen. Two years ago, we established the Michigan Engineering Zone in the University’s Detroit Center on Woodward Avenue. Now, each year, the College of Engineering provides space for more than a dozen FIRST teams and more than 100 high-school students to create robots for competition. I understand you’ll meet some of the talented FIRST participants (and future engineers) later today.</p>

<p>I share the view of this conference that Michigan can become a global leader in robotics and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>But if the U.S. is to maintain a strong position in domestic manufacturing, developing the next generation of our engineering talent will be critical. Higher-education institutions provide a bridge between secondary schools and the robotics industry. Programs such as FIRST show young people that the challenging work of creating new technologies can be fun, rewarding and well worth it.</p>

<p>Robotics research taking place here at Michigan and elsewhere within this state, and the FIRST Robotics competition should charge the batteries of all of us who believe in this state’s potential to build the industries and produce the jobs of the future.</p>

<p>I’m proud of the role academic institutions are playing in contributing to the growth of robotics. Universities offer long-term horizons, resources that can be employed with significant independence, the tradition of exchanging ideas with peer institutions, and a commitment to education – all factors that can enhance the progress of robotics development.</p>

<p>Yet the “fiendish complications” of robotics that Professor Olson cites will demand our brightest minds, our best collaborations and our boldest investments.</p>

<p>To maximize opportunities, universities will need to overcome departmental barriers and sustain the trend of interdisciplinary collaboration. Industry will have to commit to some long-term R&amp;D investments. Government must be able to make the case that robotics is a priority public interest.</p>

<p>Breakthroughs we seek today may not be realized until long after I am dean and Senator Levin is no longer in office. And in the marketplace, there will be losses on the way to victory. But time, money and risk are the costs of industry leadership. I am confident this state is up to the challenge. By your presence today, you indicate that you agree.</p>

<p>I wish you continued progress in your important efforts to secure Michigan’s place as a global leader in robotics. For the sake of academic research, economic development and national security, best wishes for great success.</p></div>
