Hey Mike,

I don't know if you have any bands who might be interested in submitting for this, but I wanted to check in!  We have cleared the song "Beyond The Sea" for an upcoming Carl's Jr/Hardee's commercial (see specs below).  We would love a ROCKIN version of this song instead of the below Bobby Darin master.  We do not have any $ for demos, The demo should not be recorded under any union.  I have attached a brief that describes what we are looking for.

This may be a fantastic opportunity for an upcoming band to get their name and sound to a huge demographic of "young hungry guys" (18-34) who frequently discuss the music used in our spots in social media.  It would be ideal for us to get these demos no later than Thurs EOD.
