Who&#039;s having an impact?
http://mconnex.engin.umich.edu/alumni-groups/alumni-board/alumni-awards/#nominations
It&#039;s your last chance to let us know about a fellow Michigan Engineer who is out there making a difference in the world. Last year Wataru Mizumachi earned the Alumni Medal for his efforts to improve the safety of nuclear power. Who will it be this time? Nominate someone by April 5.

Nanoscale drug carriers get trapped by red blood cells
http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/about/news/stories/2013/february/drugcarrier
Researchers are pursuing designs that will allow drug-carrying nanoparticles to navigate tissues and the interiors of cells, but chemical engineering professor Omolola Eniola-Adefeso and her team discovered that these particles have another hurdle to overcome: escaping the bloodstream.

How do you land a probe on a comet?

With fly-bys by Pan-STARRS and Comet ISON, 2013 has been called the &quot;Year of the Comet&quot;. But next year is when the fun happens, as we try to land a probe with the Rosetta project. U-M AOSS professor Mike Combi explains the mission to MconneX.

From running roaches to robots
http://mconnex.engin.umich.edu/michepedia/2013/from-running-roaches-to-robots/
Professor Shai Revzen is recording the reaction of running cockroaches being shoved sideways, discovering that their body kicks in before their dawdling nervous system can tell it what to do.

Still making a difference after 10 years

There&#039;s been a lot of talk lately about humans going to Mars. But the engineering challenges for getting there are as great as the goal itself. MconneX asks spacecraft and plasmadynamics professor Ben Longmier what he thinks it will take to get people to the red planet.

Webinar: Aviation in the 21st Century
