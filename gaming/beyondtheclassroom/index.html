Sophia Powers was one of the ones 11 years ago. One of her arms is shorter and weaker than the other. The condition's main treatment is  physical therapy, but that can be hard to maintain. At the U-M Health System's Brachial Plexus Palsy camp this summer, Powers tried out Path, one of the therapeutic games Michigan Engineering students developed.  At times, Powers had to stretch and use her stronger arm to guide her affected limb.">

That's one reason it impressed Laura. &quot;It's also high interest,&quot; she said. &quot;It creates mind-body awareness.
