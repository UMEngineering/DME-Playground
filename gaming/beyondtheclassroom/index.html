                	<p>To fine-tune the video games and move them closer to the hands of the populations they could help, a group of students from computer science and engineering instructor David Chesney's freshman and senior classes worked together through the summer. In addition to collaborating with the U-M Health Systems Mott Family Network to make games from both classes available to hospital patients, the young engineers put their products to the test with several groups of potential users.

“It’s been really fun to see the games actually work,” Moosa said. “The kids seem to enjoy it, and that kind of surprises me because I tend to take a very critical look at my own work.”

She and her mom, Laura Powers, both chuckle at the prospect. They concede that it might help boost strength and range of motion in her weaker arm.  “But with the Wii, I can cheat,” Sophia said. “I can just switch to my right arm.” Path, one of the beneficial games Michigan Engineering students developed, is harder to fool. That’s one reason it impressed Laura. “It’s also high interest,” she said. “It creates mind-body awareness. She sees where her arm goes in space.” Here, Laura talks with Connor Davidson, a computer science and engineering sophomore who is working to bring the games to people they could help, while Sophia practices.
