                	<p>He chalks it up to his Catholic upbringing, but David Chesney can’t help but shoehorn some good into unexpected places. “I’ve always tried to build social context into the courses I teach,” said the University of Michigan computer science instructor. </p>

                    <p>So his section of ENGIN 100, a required course for all Michigan Engineering freshmen, is “Gaming for the Greater Good.” </p>
                    
                    <p>Up until a few years ago, he was often inundated with algebra-teaching programs, as students would often build games around their favorite subject in high school.</p>
                    
                    <div id="withimg">
                    <a id="main2" href="img/main2.png" title="Gaming for the greater good"><img id="main2" src="img/main2.png" alt="team" /></a>
                    <p>Then, on a whim, he toured the special needs classroom in his daughter’s elementary school. There, he saw the technology set-up for a quadriplegic kid who had been injured in a car accident as a toddler. </p>
                    
                    <p>“The device they had set up for him was a camera on top of his PC, and they’d put a metallic dot on his head that would move the cursor,” Chesney said. “That’s the main way he’d interface with his computer.” </p>
                    
                    <p>Chesney was struck. “If anyone deserves to play a fantasy computer game, it’s this kid,” he remembers thinking. </p>
                    
                    <p>He lifted a Nintendo controller that was setting on the table in front of him. “This is what today’s gaming interface looks like. I can barely use it.”</p>
                    
                    <p>That tour would change the course of his course. </p></div>
