Professor Shai Revzen is recording the reaction of running cockroaches being shoved sideways, discovering that their body kicks in before their dawdling nervous system can tell it what to do. \n\nThese new insights on how biological systems stabilize could one day help engineers design steadier robots and improve doctors' understanding of human gait abnormalities.\n\nABOUT THE PROFESSOR: Shai Revzen (http:\/\/shrevzen.nfshost.com\/) is an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science (http:\/\/www.eecs.umich.edu\/) at the University of Michigan. His research focuses on the role of mechanical dynamics in the control of animal and robot motion.\n\nMORE: Watch additional MichEpedia videos or join the discussion at http:\/\/\nwww.engin.umich.edu\/info\/alumni\/mconnex\/michepedia\/"}],"day":"thursday","date":"Feb-21-2013"},{"feeds":[{"feed":"blog","feedUrl":"http:\/\/umengineering.tumblr.com\/","actionCopy":"view","name":"umengineering","postUrl":"http:\/\/umengineering.tumblr.com\/post\/43565003535","title":"Snow cruisin' Baja style","image":"http:\/\/www.engin.umich.edu\/umLogo.png","metaData":"","imageUrl":"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/6150ef4cf487eb8ecf7cf32680d92b41\/tumblr_inline_miiuvngaGr1qz4rgp.jpg","mainContent":"If anybody knows how to rock it out in the snow, its the Michigan Baja Racing team.\nThe team headed out to the UP this weekend (thats Upper Peninsula for all you non-Michiganders) for some practice time with the vehicles.
