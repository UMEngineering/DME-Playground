            <div class="container">
                <p class="content">Stripped of any controversy, that – in a nutshell – is how the shale gas revolution is happening one well at a time. So much gas has been coming up from ancient, deep rock formations known as shale that the United States has become the world's top gas producer, and could be a net exporter by 2035.</p>

                <p class="content">The combination and advancement of two relatively old techniques – horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking – have made this possible. They're enabling industry to tap trillions of cubic feet of gas from places previously deemed too expensive or difficult to get to. Now they're being used to go after oil as well.</p>

                <p class="content">"There's a lot that has to come together to make something like this happen," said Johannes Schwank, a chemical engineering professor at the University of Michigan who is researching fracking technology as part of a university-wide study on the practice.</p>

                <p class="content">"It's a remarkable feat of engineering when you think about it."</p>

                <p class="content">Shale is the source rock where the natural gas was made. These formations – known to exist in 32 countries – trace their roots to the days before the dinosaurs, when sand and silt settled with dead animals and plants on the bottoms of shallow seas.</p>

                <p class="content">Before horizontal drilling and fracking, you couldn't tap source rock. You had to find a reservoir of gas – a holding tank – sealed with cap rock that was keeping the fuel in place. What makes shale special, and also tough to tap, is that it's the source, the reservoir and the cap, all in one. To learn more about how hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling pry the gas from its grasp, the College of Engineering visited a well in the early stages of drilling in Pennsylvania.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Drill down more than a mile</li>

                <p class="content">In late January, snow dusted the Endless Mountains of Susquehanna County, one of the earliest epicenters of gas drilling on this side of the Mississippi. In this county, Cabot Oil and Gas alone has 200 wells that reach down to the Marcellus shale, now believed to hold one of the world's largest reserves of gas. On a farm off a dirt road, a drilling rig stood 10 stories high on a 10 acre-well pad.</p>

                <p class="content">Halfway up, in a control room known as the dog house, the driller sat in a captain's chair flanked with computer monitors, facing a window out to the rig floor. Outside, a 17.5-inch mud-coated bit spiraled down.</p>

                <p class="content">"How deep are we?" asked Bill deRosier, Cabot's external affairs coordinator. </p>

                <p class="content">"About 302 feet," the driller replied. "We're in surface sandstone."</p>

                <p class="content">"By my calculations, we haven't drilled down to the aquifer yet," deRosier said. </p>

                <li>Protect the groundwater</li>

                <p class="content">In this region, the groundwater aquifer starts at about 500 feet down. The water wells of rural residents reach down to this sandy layer that's saturated like a wet sponge. The drill goes right through it, down to the hard rock at its bottom. At that point, burrowing stops so the company can reinforce the well.</p>

                <p class="content">"When everything is said and done," deRosier said, "the well through the aquifer will have four to five different layers of casing and cement to protect it from whatever we're doing inside in the Marcellus and whatever's already in the aquifer from entering our operations."</p>

                <p class="content">Historically, this hasn't always been foolproof for Cabot or other companies. While the majority of landowners with gas wells on their property haven't complained of adverse effects, some say their water has changed. In 2009 and 2010, the state fined Cabot for "defective" gas wells that it blamed for causing methane – the main component of natural gas – to migrate into the underground water supply. This is a complicated issue. Methane in water isn't a new problem in the area and Cabot maintains its operations haven't exacerbated it. Studies due out in the next few years could give telling insights.</p>

                <li>Curve the well sideways</li>

                <p class="content">Below the water table, the team keeps drilling 6,200 feet to it's destination: the Marcellus. Geologists on site verify when they get there. Then they're ready to make the turn.</p>

                <p class="content">The curve happens little by little over a quarter of a mile and 40 pieces of steel pipe. Each section is flexible enough to bend two or three degrees. Past the curve, the length of the horizontal leg can be up to a mile long, in Cabot's case. Other companies go out further. Cabot pours cement outside the length of the well. Not all companies do.</p>

                <p class="content">DeRosier points out that a horizontal well means a smaller footprint on the surface. One of these unconventional shale wells can empty and area that would take 10 to 20 vertical wells to drain.</p>

                <li>Make holes in the horizontal leg</li>

                <p class="content">Next up is "perforation." Companies have to make holes in the steel well pipe and the cement around it so their fracking fluid can reach the formation. To do this, they lower a special gun loaded with bits of explosives, said Jim Peters, operations manager for Northstar Energy explained in a phone interview. A finished well will have a couple hundred holes, each about the size of a silver dollar. The explosions bore a couple feet into the shale.</p>

                <li>Pump in the fracking fluid</li>

                <p class="content">You could think of shale as structured like baby Swiss cheese, with the gas stuck in microscopic holes.</p>

                <p class="content">"So we use hydraulic fracturing to go in and open up all the little nooks and crannies and crevices," deRosier said.</p>
                
                <p class="content">The fracking fluid used in deep gas wells today is made of five to seven million gallons of water, sand or ceramic beads to prop open the fractures, and a half of one percent total of about a dozen different chemicals, deRosier said. The chemicals kill bacteria, reduce friction and scaling, evenly distribute the sand grains, among other purposes. Some are safe to eat. Guar gum, which thickens the fluid, is common in processed baked goods, for example. But others are regulated hazardous substances, and the EPA is focusing on them in its study into whether fracking affects drinking water, due out in 2014.</p>

                <p class="content">Because today's wells are so deep and long, it takes a lot of pressure to frack them – between 8,500 and 9,000 pounds per square inch. That's like squeezing the weight of two pick-up trucks onto the space of one square inch, Peters said.</p>

                <li>Capture the gas</li>

                <p class="content">While the well is being installed, so are the underground lines that link it to the pipe network that will carry the gas to cooking stoves, home-heating furnaces and manufacturing plants. Once that's all in place, the well's footprint shrinks to 1 acre – just smaller than a football field. DeRosier expects most of his company's wells to produce gas for 50 years. So for half a century, landowners will receive royalty payments.</p>

                <p class="content">The environmental concern during this phase is air pollution. Natural gas is often considered a cleaner fuel because when it's burned, it releases fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels. That's true, but some studies have claimed that for shale wells, roughly 4 to 8 percent of the gas can leak before it gets to its point of use. Raw methane is a potent greenhouse gas – with perhaps twice the short-range warming potential as carbon dioxide.</p>

                <li>Improve the practice</li>

                <p class="content">In 2011, an MIT study counted 43 incidents related to shale gas drilling over the previous few years: two blowouts, 14 on-site surface spills and 20 reports of methane contaminating drinking water, likely due to inadequate cementing of the well casings. While the study said its list was not exhaustive, it also urged readers to put the numbers in the context of the thousands of fracked shale gas wells in the U.S. today.</p>

                <p class="content">"Let us be honest," Schwank said. "Things can happen. We have seen the nuclear reactor in Fukushima fail. A meteorite can strike. There's always the unforeseen."</p>

                <p class="content">"This technology has a track record of comparatively low failures compared to other industries," he continued. "Coal mining for example, has much higher accident rate. So does the construction industry." </p>

                <p class="content">Still, engineering researchers around the country and the world are working to make fracking a cleaner and safer process. In Pittsburg, for example, they're examining how the cement in gas wells cures in the presence of dust, mud and water. In Minnesota, they're using bacteria to clean fracking wastewater. In Japan, they're testing fracking fluids made of carbon dioxide that save water and make more fractures. </p>

                <p class="content">The feats of engineering will continue. But not everyone will be satisfied.</p>

                <p class="content">"People think technology is going to save the day. In a perfect world, it would. But humans make boo-boos, and there's too much we don't know about deep underground," said Chapman, of the Sierra Club. She's been advocating for stricter fracking laws in her state for the past few years.</p>

                <p class="content">"It comes down to what's the level of perfection that we want. I want perfect!"  she said. "I want perfect."</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p class="content">The professor picked up a brown envelope and emptied the contents into his hands: Two black rocks.</p>
                <p class="content">"What I have in front of me," said Brian Ellis, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan, "are two samples of the Marcellus shale."</p>
                <p class="content">He pointed to the tell-tale "poker chip" layering in one.</p>
                <p class="content">"This is the type of shale you're likely to produce natural gas from." </p>
                <p class="content">They had come in the mail a few weeks earlier – his lab's first specimens of the source rock that's changing the global energy landscape, dotting the American countryside with drill rigs and wells and turning the term "fracking" into a household name you can use in polite company. </p>
                <p class="content">The use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to recover gas has jumped 12-fold over the past decade in shale formations like the Marcellus under Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, and the Barnett under Texas, according to the Energy Information Administration. The U.S. now produces more natural gas than any other nation. Most recently, companies are turning to these shale drilling techniques to bring up oil in North Dakota. </p>
                <p class="content">As the scale of the industry has grown, so have concerns about its effects on the environment and human health. Ellis's work is part of an emerging field examining these issues. Over the next year in his lab, he will mimic how the chemicals in fracking fluid interact with shale more then a mile underground. He's also part of a team of U-M professors looking at fracking-related issues as they pertain to the state of Michigan. Michigan is one of 28 states that sit on potentially lucrative shale formations. </p>
                <p class="content">"I think the question still remains whether or not hydrofracking is a big deal," Ellis said. "That's the reason we as a society need to focus on this issue." </p>
                <p class="content">He is starting at a microscope that can magnify 5,000 times. </p>
                <p class="content">On the screen, his stone from subterranean West Virginia looks a little like the surface of the moon. Zoomed in closer, its pores come into focus and it resembles more a satellite view of lake country.</p>
                <p class="content">The researchers are measuring these pores, microscale catacombs where natural gas –  all that's left of plants and animals that died hundreds of millions of years ago – floats in the free space or clings to the wall. Calculating the average pore size is a step toward deeply understanding how the rock is structured and what it's made of. </p>
                <p class="content">Ellis points to a bright splotch on the screen. </p>
                <p class="content">"Right there, you can see there's some pyrite," he says to the student he's working with. </p>
                <p class="content">Pyrite is fool's gold. It often holds arsenic, a poison in high concentrations. It poses no threat underground, but it turns out fracking fluid may draw out arsenic and carry it to the surface with the fluid that comes back up the well. (Varying amounts of the injected water will flow back to the surface, with estimates ranging from 10 to 70 percent.) The chemicals in fracking fluid may mobilize other potentially dangerous elements too: the heavy metals mercury and barium, as well as the naturally occurring radioactive elements radium and uranium.</p>
                <p class="content">Ellis hopes to figure out how this happens.</p>
                <p class="content">"We're perturbing a system on a fundamental level and it's important to understand what happens after we perturb that system," he said. "So it's – okay, you just injected a bunch of fluids into the ground and you cracked a rock and now what?"</p>
                <p class="content">He's just getting started. Soon, he'll make small batches of fracking fluid, soak bits of shale in it, and monitor how the fluid changes. With the knowledge this research could provide, engineers might be able to tweak their recipes to avoid using chemicals that may enhance leaching, he said. </p>
                <p class="content">Why might they want to? Many of the substances Ellis is interested in are among the 51 the EPA is targeting in its study on whether fracking affects drinking water. The EPA chose the substances based, in part, on whether they're considered toxic. The results will come out in 2014.</p>
                <p class="content">The EPA report is one of several major forthcoming studies. Another, expected out later this year, is Geisinger Health System's health effects investigation. Researchers are combing though hundreds of thousands of medical records of people who live near gas drilling in Pennsylvania. </p>
                <p class="content">For Pennsylvania, these findings will come almost a decade – and more than 6,400 shale wells – after the first to hit paydirt in the Keystone state's Marcellus. </p>
                <p class="content">The industry, which has received special exemptions from certain federal laws that protect air and drinking water, has grown so fast that experts say science hasn't been able to keep up. </p>
                <p class="content">"What's amazing is how few papers have been published," said Robert Jackson, professor of global environmental change at Duke University. Jackson has found evidence of higher methane levels in water wells near active gas drilling.</p>
                <p class="content">"It's partly because of the pace of research. If you follow the rules of the game and send things through peer review, it takes a long time. It means that we're playing catch up. So from a policy standpoint, we're making decisions that come before the information we'd like to have. So what else is new? What's different in this case is the speed with which we're drilling and plan to drill."</p>
